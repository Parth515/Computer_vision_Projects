# Pose Estimation

## Description
This project uses MediaPipe Pose with OpenCV to detect and track human body landmarks in real time. It supports pose detection, angle calculation for joints, and visual feedback for fitness or motion analysis applications.

## Files Overview
- `pose_estimation_min.py`: Minimal example demonstrating pose detection and landmark visualization.
- `pose_example_project.py`: A more complete example applying pose estimation with repetition counting or other logic.
- `pose_module.py`: Custom module encapsulating pose detection functions and utilities.

## Features
- Real-time full-body pose detection
- Landmark visualization with skeletal connections
- Joint angle calculations for movement analysis
- FPS display for performance monitoring
