# Face_detection.ipynb script uses the basic of face detection and use two of the most basic algorithms: 
1. Cascade Classifier
2. HOG (Histograms of oriented Gradients)


# facedetection_basics.py script uses MediaPipe Face Detection, which is powered by the BlazeFace model:

BlazeFace is a lightweight, real-time CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) optimized for mobile and edge devices.

It performs single-shot detection (similar to SSD) to find faces in an image.

The model outputs:

Relative bounding boxes around faces.

Confidence score for each detection.
