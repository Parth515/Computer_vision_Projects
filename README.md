# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my **Computer Vision Projects** repository — a growing collection of practical and experimental projects exploring computer vision techniques, primarily focused on hand tracking, pose estimation, face mesh, object tracking, and more.

## About This Repository

Currently, most projects leverage [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) and OpenCV for real-time detection and tracking tasks. However, this is a personal playground where I continually experiment with different tools, libraries, and methods — including neural networks and other computer vision frameworks.

The goal is to build modular, reusable components that can evolve over time as I learn and integrate new technologies.
